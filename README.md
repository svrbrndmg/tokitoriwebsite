# Toki Tori (2001) Website Recreation
A recreation of the Toki Tori website at the time it was first released (as a Game Boy Color title in 2001)

My only addition is a little favicon of Toki Tori sleeping, hope that's okay. (I also tweaked the code a bit, but this is not a change the average user will see or care to notice)

If you download these files, open index.html and you'll have (nearly) the same experience as you would in 2001.

### UPDATE: Hosting this website on [Neocities](https://svrbrndmg.neocities.org). Bear with me as I have to put some files on an external site. (Neocities doesn't allow me to)

If something isn't right, feel free to contribute or [email](mailto:svrbrndmg@proton.me) me about it.

### [Two Tribes](https://twotribes.com) may strike this repo down if they wish. I did not create nor own any of these files.
